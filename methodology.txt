Methodology/Procedure/Algorithm

1. Initialize Data Structures:

Declare arrays for courses, subjects, students, and faculties.

Initialize counters for the number of courses, subjects, students, and faculties.

2. Display Menu and User Input:

Display the menu options to the user.

Read the user's choice.

3. Execute User Choice:

Use a switch statement to perform actions based on the user's choice.

Case 1: Add Course

Call the addCourse function.

Case 2: Add Subject

Call the addSubject function.

Case 3: Add Student

Call the addStudent' function,

Case 4: Add Faculty

Call the 'addFaculty function.

Case 5: Mark Attendance

Call the 'mark Attendance function.

Case 6: Enter Marks

Call the 'enterMarks function.

Case 7: Print Report Card

Call the printReportCard function,

Case 8: Exit

Display an exit message and end the program.

4. User Functions:

Implement functions for each user choice to perform specific actions:

addCourse: Add a new course to the courses array,

addSubject: Add a new subject to the subject's array.

addStudent: Add a new student to the student's array.

addFaculty: Add a new faculty member to the faculties array.

markAttendance: Mark attendance for a student in a specific subject. enterMarks: Enter marks for a student in a specific subject.

printReportCard: Print the report card for a specific student,

5. Data Validation:

Perform data validation to ensure that courses, subjects, and students are associated correctly.

Check if a specified course exists before adding a subject, student, or faculty related to that course.

6. Loop:

Repeat the main loop until the user chooses to exit (option 8).

7. End:

Display an exit message.

This algorithm provides a high-level overview of the program's logic, including the main flow of user interactions and the corresponding actions performed based on the user's choices, Specific details and error handling can be further refined based on the requirements and constraints of your college management system.
